# SQL queries

SQL queries to create tables and views in CSET BigQuery datasets based on data collected and processed by [AMPLYFI](https://amplyfi.com/). The statistics presented in the paper are based on the results of the [`amplyfi_for_analysis_dedupe`](https://github.com/georgetown-cset/using-machine-learning-to-fill-gaps-in-chinese-ai-market-data/blob/main/sql/amplyfi_for_analysis_deduped.sql) query, which depends in turn on the other queries in this directory. The underlying data are collected in [`Data`](https://github.com/georgetown-cset/using-machine-learning-to-fill-gaps-in-chinese-ai-market-data/blob/main/data/).
