# SQL queries

SQL queries to create tables and views in CSET BigQuery datasets based on data collected and processed by AMPLYFI. The statistics presented in the paper are based on the results of the `amplyfi_for_analysis_dedupe` query, which depends in turn on the other queries in this directory. The underlying data are collected in `cset_amplyfi_deduplicated_investments_zh_usd.json`.
